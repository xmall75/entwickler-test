# Developer Test
This repository contains 3 directories: frontend, backend, and logic. **Frontend** and **backend** should be run together while **logic** can be run separately.
## Backend
![Database Design](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/279f8356-96a2-48ff-a9bc-021fa9ee3ec3)
The image above is the database design for this system. This system has 7 tables but I only managed to create API for 4 tables only.

### Features
1. CRUD for Pegawai
2. Read only API for Jabatan, Unit Kerja, and Tempat Tugas

API Documentation: [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/27920384/2sB2j7cUzh)

For more details about **how to run**, **folder structures**, and many more can check the [README.md from backend directory](https://github.com/xmall75/developer-prufen/tree/main/backend#readme)
